# Battery Management System - State of Health (SOH)

## Qualitative description of aging
As cell ages, capacity decreases (capacity fade) and series resistance increases (power fade).
- Reductive electrolyte decomposition takes place at the electrode/electrolyte interface when the electrode is in the charged state, creating Solid electrolyte interface (SEI). SEI consumes lithium and reduces capacity
- High temperature contribute to breakdown of SEI (and regrowth of SEI). Again, lithium is consumed and cell capacity decreases.
- Cathode dissolved in electrolyte end up as part of SEI (**anode poisoning**). This part is not electrically conductivy and increases overall resistance and also blocks lithium from cycling causing capacity fade
- Low temperature causes slower lithium diffusion. If charging is force, local overpotential can attain level that causes lithium plating on particle surface. (Dramatic capacity decrease and can create a severe safety issue).
- Stresses and straing within electrodes can cause mechanical and electronical contact loss, causing higher impedance
